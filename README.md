# DG3
DG3 stands for Declarative Gestures a Go Go, a framework for defining two-dimensional gestures composed by one or more sequences of points, borrowing the syntax for ground terms and operators from consolidated gesture definition models. The program allows the management of collections of gestures defined by expressions and it is able to connect with G3’s web service to generate synthetic human-like gesture samples from each gesture’s expression. G3 is a web service that supports the artificial generation of gesture samples through a method based on the kinematic theory of rapid human movements. DG3 is also equipped with a recognizer that is able to perform online partial gesture recognition. The recognizer combines members of the $-family and it allows for the recognition of a gesture and its sub-parts as they are being performed in real-time. This project features an extensive research and testing phase for the fine tuning of the sample generation process and the recognizer’s algorithm and performance. Samples from the $1 and $N dataset were used for testing the various features of DG3.
(This tool was built under severe time constraints and some portions of it may be reworked at a later date)
